## Research Question

###*How Does Nutrition Impact Recovery From COVID-19 Infections?*

--
#### Why do we care?
--

- Studies show that maintaining a healthy diet can **decrease risk of severe infection** by promoting the immune system (Messina et al. 2020, Iddir et. al 2020).

--

- Adequate **protein consumption** is essential for antibody production and poor nutrient consumption has been shown to increase inflammation and oxidative stress (Iddir et. al 2020).

--

- There is an observed **increase in mortality rates** among patients infected with COVID-19 which have chronic inflammatory diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The prevalence of these chronic inflammatory diseases are known to be **correlated with an individual's diet** (Onishi 2020).

---

## Source and Analysis Plan

--

### Dataset:

--

- "COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset” comes from Kaggle. 

--

- Energy intake (kcal) as percentages of total diet energy intake by food group. 

--

- Provides data for total confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered COVID cases, COVID deaths, and active COVID cases for 170 countries.

--

### Analysis Plan:

--
- The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion suggests a dietary intake which consists of 30% grains, 40% vegetable, 10% fruits, and 20% proteins

--

- We want to see if the dietary of breakdown of countries aligns with the USDA suggested values and if that relationship is mediated by income

--

- Then, we will analyze whether deviation from this suggested breakdown impacts COVID-19 recovery rates

## Linear Regression Model to Assess Effects of Diet on COVID-19 Recovery Rates

--

```{r creating_deviation_varibles, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
food <- food %>% 
  mutate(deviation_grains = (30 - Grains)^2) %>% 
  mutate(deviation_veg = (40 - Vegetables2)^2) %>% 
  mutate(deviation_fruit = (10 - Fruits)^2) %>% 
  mutate(deviation_protein = (20 - Protein)^2) %>% 
  mutate(deviation_tot = deviation_grains + deviation_protein + deviation_fruit + deviation_veg) %>% 
  filter(rec_rate>0) %>% 
  filter(deviation_tot < 750)
```

```{r graphs_of_deviation_vs_recovery_rate, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 2, fig.width = 5}
food %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = deviation_tot, y = rec_rate)) +
  geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm") + labs(
    title = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate in relationship to deviation from USDA 
    suggested Dietary Intake",
    x = "Deviation from USDA suggested diet",
    y = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate")
```

---
# Linear Regression Model
--
```{r Linear_Model_no_income, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
res <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(rec_rate ~ deviation_tot, data = food) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  print()
```
--
## Adjusted R Squared
```{r Linear_Model_no_income_r2, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
linear<-lm(rec_rate~deviation_tot, data=food)
glance(linear)$adj.r.squared %>% 
  print()
```

--

- This linear regression model shows that there is a significant relationship between recovery rate and deviation rate since our p value is less than the alpha level of 0.05. For every integer increase in deviation rate, the chances of recovering are on average 0.04 lower.

--

- However, the adjusted r squared value is quite low. It indicates that our model only accounts for 5% of the variance in the data.

### Linear Regression Conditioning Income and Dietary Deviation

.pull-left[
```{r lgraphs_of_deviation_vs_recovery_rate, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
food %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = deviation_tot, y = rec_rate)) +
  geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm") + labs(
    title = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate in relationship to deviation from USDA 
    suggested Dietary Intake",
    x = "Deviation from USDA suggested diet",
    y = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r lLinear_Model_with_income_graph, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
food %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = deviation_tot, y = rec_rate, color=income)) +

    title = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate in relationship to deviation from USDA suggested Dietary Intake",
    x = "Deviation from USDA suggested diet",
    y = "COVID-19 Recovery Rate")
```
]

---

#### Linear Regression Model without income
```{r lLinear_Model_no_income, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
res <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(rec_rate ~ deviation_tot, data = food) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  print()
```

--

#### Linear Regression Model with income
```{r lLinear_Model_with_income, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
resincome <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(rec_rate ~ deviation_tot*income, data = food) %>% 
  tidy () %>% 
  print()
```

--

- This linear regression model shows that there is a significant relationship between recovery rate and deviation rate, conditioning on the other variables in the model, since our p value is less than the alpha level of 0.05. For every integer increase in deviation rate, the chances of recovering are on average 7% lower. 
--

- We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the value for
the intercepts or slopes for the other income groups is the same as that of the reference group.

- This model has a slightly larger adjusted r squared value, (6.17% compared to 5.05%) indicating that it accounts for slightly more variance in the data than the first model that did not include income

# Discussion

### Conclusion

- Significant relationship between dietary deviation and COVID-19 Recovery Rates
--

### Limitations

- Vaccination Rates

--

- Variation of Individual Ideas

--

### Future Directions

- Control for vaccination rates

--

- Investigate individuals diet
